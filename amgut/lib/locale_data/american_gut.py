Diet is a major factor affecting the gut microbiome so by changing your diet, you may be able to affect your gut microbiome. We still don\'t fully understand probiotics but know that they can influence your gut microbiome while you are actively taking them. Factors such as stress can also influence the gut microbiome.

In particular, %(shorthand)s is not a diagnostic test (although the information gained through the project may in future contribute to the development of diagnostic tests).

    'HOW_PROCESS_SAMPLES_ANS_1': 'The majority of the samples in the %(project)s are run through a processing pipeline designed to amplify a small region of a gene that is believed to be common to all Bacteria and Archaea. This gene, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene is like a barcode you find on your groceries, and serves as a marker for different organisms. There are quite a few different ways to assess the types of Bacteria and Archaea in a sample, including a variety of techniques even to look at this single gene. Every method has its biases, and comparing data between different methods is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23861384">non-trivial</a> and can sometimes be nearly impossible. One of the primary goals of the %(shorthand)s is to provide data that can be used and reused by researchers worldwide, we have opted to use the standard protocols adopted by the <a href="http://earthmicrobiome.org">Earth Microbiome Project</a>, (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402401">Caporaso et al 2012</a>, and more detailed description of the <a href="http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/16s/">protocol</a>). This ensures that the data generated by the %(shorthand)s can be combined with the other 80,000 samples so far indexed by the EMP (as scientists, we get giddy about things like this).</p>' % {'shorthand': AMGUT_CONFIG.project_shorthand, 'project': AMGUT_CONFIG.project_name},
    'HOW_PROCESS_SAMPLES_ANS_2': 'DNA sequencing is a complex challenge that involves an army of robots, ultra pure water that costs $75 per 10ml, and an amazing <a href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/miseq.ilmn">digital camera</a> that actually determines individual sequences one nucleotide at a time. The number of stunningly brilliant minds whose footprints exist in these methods is astounding. However, the challenges don\'t end once you get the DNA sequence - some might say they are just beginning. It turns out that figuring out what actually is in your sample, that is, what organisms these sequences correspond to, requires cutting edge computational approaches, supercomputers and caffeine for the people operating them. The questions being asked of the data are themselves complex, and volume of data being processed is simply phenomenal. To give you some idea, for each sample sequenced we obtain around 6 million nucleotides which we represent as letters (A, T, G or C, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">here</a> for more info), whereas Shakespeare\'s Hamlet only contains around 150,000 letters (ignoring spaces).</p>',
    'HOW_PROCESS_SAMPLES_ANS_3': 'The primary software package we use for processing 16S sequence data is called Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (<a href="http://www.qiime.org">QIIME</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383131">Caporaso et al. 2010</a>). Using this package, we are able to start with raw sequence data and process it to so that we end up be able to  explore the relationships within and between samples using a variety of statistical methods and metrics. To help in the process, we leverage a standard and comprehensive (to date) reference database called Greengenes (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22134646">McDonald  et al. 2011</a>; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16820507">DeSantis et al. 2006</a>) that includes information on a few hundred thousand Bacteria and Archaea (it is likely that there are millions or more species of bacteria). Due to the molecular limitations of our approach, and the lack of a complete reference database (because the total diversity of microbes on Earth is still unknown), our ability to determine whether a specific organism is present has a margin of error on the order of millions of years, which limits our ability to assess specific strains or even species using this inexpensive technique (more expensive techniques, such as some of the higher-level analyses and contributions, can provide this information).

Your gut exacts a kind of metamorphosis on everything you eat, turning hotdog or grilled cheese, miraculously, into energy and, ultimately, cells, signals and even thoughts.

    'INTRODUCTION_WHAT_IS_16S': "16S rRNA is a sort of telescope through which we see species that would otherwise be invisible. Let me explain. Historically, microbiologists studied bacteria and other microscopic species by figuring out what they ate and growing them, on petri dishes, in labs, in huge piles and stacks. On the basis of this approach&mdash; which required great skill and patience&mdash; thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of studies were done. But then&hellip; in the 1960s, biologists including the wonderful radical <a href=\"http://www.robrdunn.com/2012/12/chapter-8-grafting-the-tree-of-life/\">Carl Woese</a>, began to wonder if the RNA and DNA of microbes could be used to study features of their biology. The work of Woese and others led to the study of the evolutionary biology of microbes but it also eventually led to the realization that most of the microbes around us were not culturable&mdash; we didn't know what they ate or what conditions they needed. This situation persists. No one knows how to grow the vast majority of kinds of organisms living on your body and so the only way to even know they are there is to look at their RNA. There are many bits of RNA and DNA that one might look at, but a bit called 16S has proven particularly useful.",
    'INTRODUCTION_ROBOTS_HEAD': "Do you really have a robot?",

Personally, I think the fact that microbiologists study the dominant fraction of life on Earth, a fraction that carries out most of the important process (and a fair bit of inexplicable magic) makes microbiologists cool. I am not a microbiologist; I am an evolutionary biologist and a writer, but I think that microbiologists are hipsters cloaked in scientists clothing (and language). But if the outrageousness of their quarry does not convince you they are hip, well, then, let me remind you, they have robots.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The robots enable the scientists to rapidly extract the DNA and RNA from thousands of samples simultaneously. Specifically, they can load your samples into small plastic plates each with 96 little wells. The robot then loads chemicals into the wells and heats the chemically-laced wells enough to break open the bacterial cells in the sample, BAM! This releases the cell's DNA and RNA. The robots then decode the specific letters (nucleotides) of the 16S gene using the nucleotides dumped out of the broken microbial cells into these plates.",

When scientists study the microbes in your gut (and from the same samples we could also study viruses, bacteriophages&mdash; the viruses that attack bacteria&mdash;, fungi or even the presence of animals such as worms of various sorts) they do so by looking at the 16s or other genetic code of the RNA on the swabs you send us. We compare the code of each bit of RNA we find to the code of species other people have collected and also the code of the other bits of RNA in your sample. As a result, we can actually use the results of your sample to map the species living in you onto an evolutionary tree. Your own genes occupy one tiny branch on the tree of life, but the species inside of you come from all over the evolutionary tree. In fact, in some people we find species from each of the major branches of the tree of life (archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes) and then also many of the smaller branches. Inside you, in other words, are the consequences of many different and ancient evolutionary stories.",

They live in ice. They live deep in the Earth. They also live in your colon, on your skin, and so on. It is reasonable to wonder what they eat. The short answer is everything. Microbes are thousands of times more variable when it comes to their diets than are animals, plants or even fungi. Some microbes can get their nitrogen out of the air; they can, in other words, eat air. Ain't that cool. Others, like us, eat other species, munching them in the world's coolest and most ubiquitous game of packman. The bacteria in your gut are also diverse in terms of their diets. If there are two hundred species of bacteria in your gut (and there probably are at least that many) then there are at least that many different combinations of things that they are eating.",
    'INTRODUCTION_MICROBES_COME_FROM_HEAD': "Where do my microbes come from?",
    'INTRODUCTION_MICROBES_COME_FROM': "If you had asked this question a few years ago, we would have had to say the stork. But increasingly we are beginning to understand more about where the specific zoo of species in you come from and it is a little grosser than the stork. If you were born vaginally, some of your gut microbes came from your mother's feces (birth, my friend, is messy). Some came from her vagina. Others came, if you were breast fed, from her milk. It is easiest for bacteria, it seems, to colonize our guts in the first moments of life. As we age, our stomachs become acidic. We tend to think of the acid of our stomachs as aiding in digestion; it does that but another key role of our stomachs is to prevent pathogenic species from getting into our guts. The trouble with this, well, there are a couple of problems. One is c-section birth. During c-section birth, microbes need to come from somewhere other than the mother's vagina and feces. The most readily available microbes tend to be those in the hospital. As a result, the microbes in c-section babies tend to, at least initially, resemble those of the hospital more than they resemble those of other babies. With time, many c-section babies eventually get colonized by enough good bacteria (from pet dogs, pet cats, their parents' dirty hands, etc..) to get good microbes, but it is a more chancy process. But then, the big question, one we just don't know the answer to, is which and how many microbes colonize our guts as we get older. How many microbes ride through the acid bath of our stomach on our food and take up residence? We know that bad bacteria, pathogens, do this, but just how often and how good ones do it is not well worked out. You might be thinking, what about yoghurt and I'll tell you the answer, definitely, is we don't really know. Do people who eat yoghurt have guts colonized by species from that yoghurt? Maybe, possibly, I bet they do, but we don't really know (though if we get enough samples from yoghurt and non yoghurt eaters, we could know).",
    'INTRODUCTION_DISCOVER_HEAD': "What will we discover in your gut?",
    'INTRODUCTION_DISCOVER': "When the early meetings were going on about this project, everyone sat around talking about what we might see from colon samples. One scientist was sure that we would see bacteria that looked like Elvis. Another though we would find Shakespeare's great lost play. But the truth is all that we are going to see from your gut are lists of nucleotides. Let me explain&hellip;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Nucleotides are those hunks of protein out of which DNA and RNA are made. They come in different forms to which scientists have assigned names and letters. When the robots are done with the work, what they produce are lists of the nucleotides in all of 16S genes from all of the cells in your sample. These nucleotides tell the scientists which kinds of life are in your sample (and in you). But because we will only have samples of little stretches of the 16S genes, we won't know exactly which species are in you, just which lineages they are from. You might have the bacterial equivalent of a chimpanzee and a gorilla in you, but all we'll know from your sample is that there was an ape. Knowing you have a bacterial ape in your gut will, on its own, not tell you so much. The real information will come from context, statistical context. I know, that sounds boring, but I promise it is not.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>We think that hundreds of different things you do during your life, in addition to what your mother and father did (let's try not to think about that), your genes and even just where you grew up influence which species of microbes are found inside you. But we don't really know. The problem is humans are so darn complicated. What we need to be able to do is to compare large numbers of people, people who differ in many ways, to be able to sort out which variables are sometimes a little important and which ones are the big deal. Is a vegan gut very different from a vegetarian one? Does eating yoghurt make a big difference? Do the effects of a c-section birth last forever? These questions require us to compare many people, which is where you come in. Your sample, gives us context and it gives you context too. It won't be terribly exciting on its own (you will know which ancient lineages you have dividing and thriving inside you. OK, that is pretty cool on second thought), but it will be very exciting in context. Where do you fall relative to fish eaters, sick people healthy people, hunter gatherers, or even your dog? You will know and we will know. And this is not all.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>All of the questions I have mentioned so far are what I might call first order questions. How does this thing compare to that thing. But what we'd love to be able to answer are second order questions, contingent questions, questions such as whether the effect of your diet depends on your ethnicity (it probably does), whether the effect of having a dog depends on whether or not you live in the city (again, I bet it does) and so on. These questions are exactly the sort of question we have failed to be able to answer well when it comes to diet, because we don't have big enough samples sizes. We can see the forest for all of humans. Well, that isn't quite right, but you get the idea, we will be able to understand elaborate effects of multiple variables on the wilderness between your pie hole and the other hole and that, to us, is exciting.",

As more of these stories are written, they will appear here, eventually as an ebook, an ebook that you can reference when you find out what lives inside you to know whether your constant companion is a species we know everything about or, as is more typical, no one has ever studied.

<p align='center'><b>Explaining variability in the human microbiome</b></p>


<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?</p>
<p>Professor Rob Knight is conducting a research study to find out more about the microbiome (harmless or beneficial microorganisms (tiny living things such as bacteria) that live on and within your body). You have been asked to participate in this study because you, and everyone else on earth have a unique microbiome, and the more people we study of all ages will help us to understand how the micro-organisms may help or harm us. There will be approximately 1000 participants in total.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Why is this study being done?</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to try to understand why different kinds of microorganisms live on and within different people. We are interested in learning whether people with similar age, diet, environment, family, pets, body weight, or other features, also have similar microorganisms. Investigating this question will help us determine how microorganisms contribute to human biology and human health.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?</p>
<p>If you agree to to take part in this study, the following will happen to you: You will be asked to sign this assent form and then complete a survey about what you eat, how old you, are, whether you are a boy or girl, how tall you are and how much you weigh.</p>
<p>Then you will be asked to sample yourself  with the swabs (look like Q-tips) we give you.  The most common sample is of your poop (stool) where you apply a small smear to the tips of the swab from used toilet tissue.  You may also sample any area of skin, your tongue or mouth, your nostrils, ear wax, vagina, hair or nails. The sampling is usually done by you at home or with the help of your mom or dad if it is in a hard to reach place.  We will ask you if you are willing to let us use what is left of your sample for other studies.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>None of these samples will allow us to make a diagnosis of disease.</p>
<p>We intend to look at the different types of bacteria in your sample by getting out their DNA - we won't take out any of your DNA.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?</p>
<p>It should take you about 30 minutes to answer the survey questions and less than 15 minutes each time we ask you for a sample.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What risks are associated with this study?</p>
<p>It is unlikely that there are risks to you from taking part in the study.  The investigation staff have taken precautions to ensure that there is minimal risk of your private information leaking out.  If the information about you were to become public the impilications are minimal because the tests cannot be used for diagnosis.</p>

<p>Because this is a research study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</p>
<p>You do not have to participate. No harm would come to you.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</p>
<p>There is no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study. The investigator may learn more about the human microbiome in health and disease and benefit everyone.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?</p>
<p>Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without upsetting the researchers. You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can you be withdrawn from the study without your assent?</p>
<p>You may be withdrawn from if you do not sign this form. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</p>
<p>You will not be financially compensated in this study.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What if you are injured as a direct result of being in this study?</p>
<p>If you are injured or become ill as a direct result of this research study, you will be provided with medical care.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What about your confidentiality?</p>
<p>Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. All data about you that is entered on the survey is stored on a password-protected server located at the SDSC card access controlled facility at UCSD. The code key (that records which barcode or sample name was on your sample) is stored on a separate password-protected server that is accessible only to Professor Knightand Dr Gail Ackermann.  All analysis is done on data that has no record of who you are.  We will put the data into a place where other reseachers can access it, but there will not be a way of determining who you are from what is in there.</p>

<p>Research records may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Who can you call if you have questions?</p>
<p>Dr Rob Knight and/or Gail Ackermann has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have other questions or research-related problems, you may reach Dr Knight at 858-246-1184</p>

<p>You may call the Human Research Protections Program Office at (858) 246-7444 to inquire about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Your Signature and Assent</p>
<p>You have received a copy of this assent document and a copy of the "Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights" to keep.</p>

Consent to Act as a Research Subject</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;' align='center'>American Gut Project</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?</p>
<p>Dr Rob Knight is conducting a research study to find out more about the trillions of bacteria and other organisms (called your microbiome) that live in and on your body. You have been asked to participate in this study because your microbiome is unique - not the same as anyone else on earth. There will be approximately 20,000 participants in the study from across the USA and from other countries around the world.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Why is this study being done?</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to more accurately assess the differences between people and whether these differences can be attributable to lifestyle, diet, body type, age or the presence of associated diseases.  The results will be used to create a database of sequence data derived from bacterial DNA in various body sites (e.g. skin, mouth, gut) and details about the participant supplying the sample from these different people that can be used by other researchers when they need samples to compare to what they are studying e.g. certain diseases where gut abnormalities are common.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What will happen to you in this study?</p>
<p>You are being asked if you want to be in this study because you signed up for microbial analysis on the American gut website. When you signed up we sent you a sample kit with instructions on how to login to the website so that you can consent to the study formally.</p>

<p>The level of analysis available to you will depend on your contribution but all participants will have to consent to be a part of the study.
The following tests are available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out who is in your microbiome - which bacteria and other microbes that are similar to bacteria called archaea are present in your child's sample ($99/swab kit);</li>
<li>You plus the world - This is two kits: 1 for your child and one for someone from Africa, South America or Asia. Your support of for the second sample will allow us to sequence more people from around the world as part of our ongoing research ($129/kit);</li>
<li>Microbes for two, three or four - which bacteria and other microbes that are similar to bacteria called archaea are present in your child's sample and one, two or three other samples;</li>
<li>A week of feces - seven stool swab samples to be used any way you want - to track the effects of an antibiotic on your gut, effect of foreign travel e.g. ($500/7sample kit);</li>
<li>All in the Family - Where bacterial DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present (also called "shallow shotgun metagenomic analysis") of up to four fecal samples with analysis of the pathways used by bacteria to signal other bacteria or within themselves;</li>
<li>Beyond Bacteria - Deeper shotgun metagenome and virome characterization (where bacterial DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present making use of additional gene parts that can tell us if there are any associated viruses or virus products that "talk " with bacteria, fungus and parasites that may be present in the sample from your gut.  Requires shipment of a whole stool sample (materials and return FedEx postage included) ($2500/kit);</li>
<li>Functional Feces - Additional characterization of gut samples over time (up to 7 stool samples, providing an analysis of the variability of functions over time. Here too the DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present (also called "shotgun metagenomic analysis").</li>
</ol>
<p>We will analyze all samples where the consent form and questionnaire is completed.  The samples in the project (including yours) will be analyzed and published as a scientific article defining the range of diversity in the human microbiome.  You will get a link to view, download and print a high-resolution certificate suitable for framing of your results and access to a more detailed list of the different organisms present in your sample (taxonomy summary).</p>
<p>We would like you to understand from the consent what we will do with your sample and what you will get in return.</p>

<p>We will ask you to complete an online questionnaire about you your lifestyle and what you eat.  We estimate that this should take no more than 30 minutes. You will then sample a part of your body (of interest to you) with a sterile Q-tip like swab by rubbing the surface of your skin, rubbing the surface of your tongue or sampling your stool by inserting the tip of the swab into used toilet tissue.  You can also sample other parts of your body - ear, nose, vagina, scalp, sole of foot. The swabs should be returned to us in the envelope provided using regular US mail service. DNA will be extracted from the sample and amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and then sequenced to see what bacteria are present and in what proportion in your sample. We estimate that it will take 2 months for you to learn the results.</p>
<p>For the Beyond Bacteria package you will submit a whole stool sample in a designated collection device on special ice packs (that reliably cool the sample to -20 degrees celsius/-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in a container that we will provide.  The results for "Beyond Bacteria" and "All in the family" will take longer to analyze because more extensive analysis is provided.  Results will be uploaded to your American Gut account when they are available.  We are also asking you to consent to having your sample or the bacterial DNA from it to be used in future studies.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Please Note: The sequencing is not for diagnostic purposes and does not target human DNA.

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?</p>
<p>To complete the online questionnaire should take 30 minutes or less.  Each sample you send can be obtained in 5 minutes or less.  We expect the study to continue for 5 years but your results will be available to you before the end of the study (usually within 2 months of us receiving the sample).  You can elect to sample yourself more than once. If your personal details change (e.g. address, or your heath status) we request that you voluntarily re-enter your responses to the questionnaire.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What risks are associated with this study?</p>
<p>The sampling techniques have been used for ~5 years with no reported side effects. We do not target the human DNA that may be in the sample so personal information about your genome will not be available to us.  The investigation personnel have taken precautions to ensure that there is minimal risk of loss of confidentiality.  Should confidentiality be compromised, the implications to you are minimal since the results are not diagnostic and have no implications for insurance companies that could compromise your insurability.</p>
<p>Because this is a research study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</p>
<p>The study is entirely voluntary and not participating will have no consequence.  There is no alternative test.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</p>
<p>There is no direct benefit to you for participating in this study. We believe that there may be natural curiosity to know what microbes are in your sample and how this compares to other people of the same gender and age. The investigator, however, will learn more about the human microbiome in health and disease and provide a valuable resource for other researchers in other studies.  Your contribution to the project may be eligible as a tax-deduction.  The receipt will be sent to you from the site that handles financial contributions.</p>

<p>We will analyze all samples where the consent form and questionnaire is completed.  The samples in the project (including yours) will be analyzed and published as a scientific article.  You will get a link to view, download and print a high-resolution certificate suitable for framing of your results and access to more detailed taxa report of your results.</p>
<p>The results from analysis of your sample/s cannot be used by you or your doctor to confirm a clinical diagnosis and we are not testing for infectious disease.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?</p>
<p>Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study, you will be requested to contact the American Gut Project helpline to inform us of your intent to withdraw.  If your sample has not been processed you may request a refund which will be processed through the site where you contributed to the project.</p>
<p>You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can you be withdrawn from the study without your consent?</p>
<p>You may be withdrawn from the study if you do not complete the consent. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</p>
<p>You will not be financially compensated in this study.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?</p>
<p>You will be asked to contribute money to the project commensurate with the investigation you request ($99 for one sample, $1500 for "All in the family" (shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing) and $2500 for "Beyond Bacteria" (deeper shotgun metagenome and virome characterization of one sample, plus additional sequencing). A receipt will be sent to you after you pay for the analysis you are requesting.  These contributions are used to partially finance the project.  Any additional funds required are provided from the funds UCSD has provided to Dr. Knight to set up his laboratory.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What if you are injured as a direct result of being in this study?</p>
<p>If you are injured as a direct result of participation in this research, the University of California will provide any medical care you need to treat those injuries. The University will not provide any other form of compensation to you if you are injured. You may call the Human Research Protections Program Office at (858) 246-7444 for more information about this, to inquire about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What about your confidentiality?</p>
<p>Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. All data about you that is entered on the web site is stored on a password-protected server located at the SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer Center) card access controlled facility at UCSD.  Financial information from participants contributing to the project is not accessible to the researchers.  The code key (that relates participant personal information to sample barcodes) is retained on a separate password-protected server that is accessible only to the PI, Co-I, sample coordinator and the database coders.  All analysis is done on de-identified data and the data deposited in a public repository for use by other investigators, is similarly de-identified. Research records may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>You will provide information about yourself that could allow you to be identified if it was made public e.g. name, age, birthdate, address.  We have made every effort to ensure that you cannot be identified from the data you supply about yourself but retaining critical information like gender, age without compromising your personal information or the data integrity.</p>

<p>We may need to report information about known or reasonably suspected incidents of abuse or neglect of a child, dependent adult or elder including physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse or neglect. The only way we could discover such abuse is if it is self-reported by the participant or the legal guardian, so this is not likely.  If any investigator has or is given such information, he or she may report such information to the appropriate authorities.</p>

    'CONSENT_YOUR_CHILD': '''<p align='center'>University of California, San Diego<br/>
Parent Consent for Child to Act as a Research Subject<br/></p>

<p align='center' style='font-weight: bold;'>American Gut Project</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Who is conducting the study, why your child been asked to participate, how your child was selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?</p>
<p>Dr. Rob Knight is conducting a research study to find out more about the trillions of bacteria and other organisms (called the microbiome) that live in and on the body. You are volunteering your child for this study because you want to know more about the microbiome of your child. Children like all humans have a unique microbiome and including them in the study will help elucidate the development of the microbiome. There will be approximately 20,000 participants in the study from across the USA and from other countries around the world.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Why is this study being done?</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to more accurately assess the differences between people and whether these differences can be attributable to lifestyle, diet, body type, age or the presence of associated diseases.  The results will be used to create a database of sequence data derived from bacterial DNA in various body sites (e.g. skin, mouth, gut) and details about the child participant supplying the sample  that can be used by other researchers when they need samples to compare to what they are studying e.g. certain diseases where gut abnormalities are common.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What will happen to your child in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?</p>
<p>You are being asked if you want your child to be in this study because you signed up for microbial testing on the American gut website. When you signed up we sent you a sample kit with instructions on how to login to the website so that you can consent to the study formally.</p>

<p>The level of analysis available to you will depend on your contribution but all participants will have to consent to be a part of the study.
The following tests are available:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out who is in your microbiome - which bacteria and other microbes that are similar to bacteria called archaea are present in your child's sample ($99/swab kit);</li>
<li>You plus the world - This is two kits: 1 for your child and one for someone from Africa, South America or Asia. Your support of for the second sample will allow us to sequence more people from around the world as part of our ongoing research ($129/kit);</li>
<li>Microbes for two, three or four - which bacteria and other microbes that are similar to bacteria called archaea are present in your child's sample and one, two or three other samples;</li>
<li>A week of feces - seven stool swab samples to be used any way you want - to track the effects of an antibiotic on your gut, effect of foreign travel e.g. ($500/7sample kit);</li>
<li>All in the Family - Where bacterial DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present (also called "shallow shotgun metagenomic analysis") of up to four fecal samples with analysis of the pathways used by bacteria to signal other bacteria or within themselves;</li>
<li>Beyond Bacteria - Deeper shotgun metagenome and virome characterization (where bacterial DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present making use of additional gene parts that can tell us if there are any associated viruses or virus products that "talk " with bacteria, fungus and parasites that may be present in the sample from your gut.  Requires shipment of a whole stool sample (materials and return FedEx postage included) ($2500/kit);</li>
<li>Functional Feces - Additional characterization of gut samples over time (up to 7 stool samples, providing an analysis of the variability of functions over time. Here too the DNA is sliced up into fragments and then reassembled to see what genes are present (also called "shotgun metagenomic analysis").</li>
</ol>
<p>We will analyze all samples where the consent form and questionnaire is completed.  The samples in the project (including your child's) will be analyzed and published as a scientific article defining the range of diversity in the human microbiome.  You will get a link to view, download and print a high-resolution certificate suitable for framing of your results and access to more detailed list of the different organisms present in your sample (taxonomy summary).</p>
<p>We would like you to understand from the consent what we will do with your child's sample and what you will get in return.</p>

<p>We will ask you to complete an online questionnaire about your child's lifestyle and what he/she eats.  We estimate that this should take no more than 30 minutes. You will then sample a part of your child's body (of interest to you) with a sterile Q-tip like swab by rubbing the surface of your skin, rubbing the surface of your tongue or sampling your stool by inserting the tip of the swab into used toilet tissue.  You can also sample other parts of her/his body - ear, nose, vagina, scalp, sole of foot. The swabs should be returned to us in the envelope provided using regular US mail service. DNA will be extracted from the sample and amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and then sequenced to see what bacteria are present and in what proportion in your sample. We estimate that it will take 2 months for you to learn the results.</p>
<p>For the Beyond Bacteria package you will submit a whole stool sample in a designated collection device on special ice packs (that reliably cool the sample to -20 degrees celsius/-4 degrees Fahrenheit) packed in a container that we will provide. The results for "Beyond Bacteria" and "All in the family" will take longer because more extensive analysis is provided.  Results will be uploaded to your American Gut account when they are available.  We are also asking you to consent to having your child's sample or the bacterial DNA from it to be used in future studies.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Please Note: The sequencing is not for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>How much time will each study procedure take, what is your child's total time commitment, and how long will the study last?</p>
<p>To complete the online questionnaire should take 30 minutes or less.  Each sample you send can be obtained in 5 minutes or less.  We expect the study to continue for 5 years but the results will be available to you before the end of the study (usually within 2 months of us receiving the sample).  You can choose to sample your child more than once.  If your child's personal details change (e.g. address, or heath status) we request that you voluntarily re-enter that information into the questionnaire.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What risks are associated with this study?</p>
<p>The sampling techniques have been used for ~5 years with no reported side effects. We do not target the human DNA that may be in the sample so personal information about your child's genome will not be available.  The investigation personnel have taken precautions to ensure that there is minimal risk of loss of confidentiality.  Should confidentiality be compromised, the implications to your child are minimal since the results are not diagnostic and have no implications for insurance companies that could compromise your child's insurability.</p>
<p>Because this is a research study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What are the alternatives to participating in this study?</p>
<p>The study is entirely voluntary and not allowing your child to participate will have no consequence.  There is no alternative test.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What benefits can be reasonably expected?</p>
<p>There is no direct benefit to your child for participating in this study. The investigator, however, may learn more about the human microbiome in health and disease and provide a valuable resource for other researchers in other studies.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can you choose to not to have your child participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?</p>
<p>There is no direct benefit to you or your child for participating in this study. We believe that there may be natural curiosity to know what bacteria are in your sample and how this compares to other people of the same gender and age. The investigator, however, will learn more about the human microbiome in health and disease and provide a valuable resource for other researchers in other studies.  Your contribution to the project may be eligible as a tax-deduction.  The receipt will be sent to you from the site that handles financial contributions.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>We will analyze all samples where the consent form and questionnaire is completed.  The samples in the project (including your child's) will be analyzed and published as a scientific article.  You will get a link to view, download and print a high-resolution certificate suitable for framing of your results and access to more detailed taxa report of your results.</p>
<p>The results from analysis of your sample/s cannot be used by you or your doctor to confirm a clinical diagnosis and we are not testing for infectious disease.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Can your child be withdrawn from the study without your consent?</p>
<p>Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw your child from the study at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study, you will be requested to contact the American Gut Project helpline to inform us of your intent to withdraw.  If your sample has not been processed you may request a refund which will be processed through the site where you contributed to the project.</p>
<p>You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Will you be compensated for participating in this study?</p>
<p>You will not be financially compensated in this study.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?</p>
<p>You will be asked to contribute money to the project commensurate with the investigation you request ($99 for one sample, $1500 for "All in the family" (shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing) and $2500 for "Beyond Bacteria" (deeper shotgun metagenome and virome characterization of one sample, plus additional sequencing). A receipt will be sent to you after you pay for the analysis you are requesting.  These contributions are used to partially finance the project.  Any additional funds required are provided from the funds UCSD has provided to Dr. Knight to set up his laboratory.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What if your child is injured as a direct result of being in this study?</p>
<p>If your child is injured as a direct result of participation in this research, the University of California will provide any medical care you need to treat those injuries. The University will not provide any other form of compensation to you if your child is injured. You or your child may call the Human Research Protections Program Office at (858) 246-7444 for more information about this, to inquire about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.</p>

<p style='font-weight: bold;'>What about your confidentiality?</p>
<p>Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. All data about your child that is entered on the web site is stored on a password-protected server located at the SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer Center) card access controlled facility at UCSD.  Financial information from participants contributing to the project is not accessible to the researchers.  The code key (that relates participant personal information to sample barcodes) is retained on a separate password-protected server that is accessible only to the PI, Co-I, sample coordinator and the database coders.  All analysis is done on de-identified data and the data deposited in a public repository for use by other investigators, is similarly de-identified. Research records may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>You will provide information about yourself that could allow you to be identified if it was made public e.g. name, age, birthdate, address.  We have made every effort to ensure that you cannot be identified from the data you supply about yourself but retaining critical information like gender, age without compromising your personal information or the data integrity.</p>
<p>We may need to report information about known or reasonably suspected incidents of abuse or neglect of a child, dependent adult or elder including physical, sexual, emotional, and financial abuse or neglect. The only way we could discover such abuse is if it is self-reported by the participant or the legal guardian, so this is not likely.  If any investigator has or is given such information, he or she may report such information to the appropriate authorities.</p>

This name allows us to understand how closely related two organisms are to each other. There are seven major levels of taxonomy that go from less specific to more specific. The phylum level represents very broad range of organisms that have <strong>evolved over hundreds of millions of years</strong> whereas the species level represents only a small subset of them that are <strong>much more closely related</strong>. Typically, names at the genus and species levels are written in <em>italics</em> or are <u>underlined</u> (in our tables, they are <em>italicized</em>).

Firmicutes encompass bacteria that can be found in many different environments ranging from soil to wine to your gut. There are currently more than 274 genera representing 7 different classes of which Clostridia (anaerobes - no oxygen) and Bacilli (obligate or facultative aerobes) are the most significant.

Their representatives are organized within 4 major classes among which the genus <em>Bacteroides</em> in the class of Bacteroidia is the most prevalent and the most studied. Bacteroidetes together with Firmicutes make up the majority of gut bacteria.
