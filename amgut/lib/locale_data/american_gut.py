    'INTRODUCTION_WHAT_IS_PROJECT': "<p>The %(project_name)s is a project in which scientists aim to work with non-scientists both to help them (AKA, you) understand the life inside their own guts and to do science. Science is coolest when it is informs our daily lives and what could possibly be more daily than what goes on in your gut? One of the big questions the %(project_shorthand)s scientists hope to figure out is what characterizes healthy and sick guts (or even just healthier and sicker guts) and how one might move from the latter to the former. Such is the sort of big lofty goal these scientists dream about at night (spirochetes rather than sugarplums dancing through their heads), but even the more ordinary goals are exciting. Even just beginning to know how many and which species live in our guts will be exciting, particularly since most of these species have never been studied, which is to say there are almost certainly new species inside you, though until you sample yourself (and all the steps that it takes to look at a sample happen&mdash; the robots, the swirling, the head scratching, the organizing of massive datasets), we won't know which ones. Not many people get to go to the rainforest to search for, much less discover, a new kind of monkey, but a new kind of bacteria, well, it is within (your toilet paper's) reach." % {'project_shorthand': AMGUT_CONFIG.project_shorthand, 'project_name': AMGUT_CONFIG.project_name},
    'INTRODUCTION_WHAT_IS_16S': "16S rRNA is a sort of telescope through which we see species that would otherwise be invisible. Let me explain. Historically, microbiologists studied bacteria and other microscopic species by figuring out what they ate and growing them, on petri dishes, in labs, in huge piles and stacks. On the basis of this approach&mdash; which required great skill and patience&mdash; thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of studies were done. But then&hellip; in the 1960s, biologists including the wonderful radical <a href=\"http://www.robrdunn.com/2012/12/chapter-8-grafting-the-tree-of-life/\">Carl Woese</a>, began to wonder if the RNA and DNA of microbes could be used to study features of their biology. The work of Woese and others led to the study of the evolutionary biology of microbes but it also eventually led to the realization that most of the microbes around us were not culturable&mdash; we didn't know what they ate or what conditions they needed. This situation persists. No one knows how to grow the vast majority of kinds of organisms living on your body and so the only way to even know they are there is to look at their RNA. There are many bits of RNA and DNA that one might look at, but a bit called 16S has proven particularly useful.",
    'INTRODUCTION_MICROBES_COME_FROM': "If you had asked this question a few years ago, we would have had to say the stork. But increasingly we are beginning to understand more about where the specific zoo of species in you come from and it is a little grosser than the stork. If you were born vaginally, some of your gut microbes came from your mother's feces (birth, my friend, is messy). Some came from her vagina. Others came, if you were breast fed, from her milk. It is easiest for bacteria, it seems, to colonize our guts in the first moments of life. As we age, our stomachs become acidic. We tend to think of the acid of our stomachs as aiding in digestion; it does that but another key role of our stomachs is to prevent pathogenic species from getting into our guts. The trouble with this, well, there are a couple of problems. One is c-section birth. During c-section birth, microbes need to come from somewhere other than the mother's vagina and feces. The most readily available microbes tend to be those in the hospital. As a result, the microbes in c-section babies tend to, at least initially, resemble those of the hospital more than they resemble those of other babies. With time, many c-section babies eventually get colonized by enough good bacteria (from pet dogs, pet cats, their parents' dirty hands, etc..) to get good microbes, but it is a more chancy process. But then, the big question, one we just don't know the answer to, is which and how many microbes colonize our guts as we get older. How many microbes ride through the acid bath of our stomach on our food and take up residence? We know that bad bacteria, pathogens, do this, but just how often and how good ones do it is not well worked out. You might be thinking, what about yoghurt and I'll tell you the answer, definitely, is we don't really know. Do people who eat yoghurt have guts colonized by species from that yoghurt? Maybe, possibly, I bet they do, but we don't really know (though if we get enough samples from yoghurt and non yoghurt eaters, we could know)."

Their representatives are organized within 4 major classes among which the genus <em>Bacteroides</em> in the class of Bacteroidia is the most prevalent and the most studied.

Firmicutes encompass bacteria that can be found in many different environments ranging from soil to wine to your gut. There are currently more than 274 genera representing 7 different classes of which Clostridia (anaerobes - no oxygen) and Bacilli (obligate or facultative aerobes) are the most significant.
